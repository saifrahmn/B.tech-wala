# B.Tech Wala - 4-Week Course on C/C++ and DSA

Welcome to the B.Tech Wala 4-week course on C/C++ and DSA! In this course, you will learn the basics of programming using the C and C++ programming languages and the fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This course is designed for B.Tech students who want to improve their coding skills and gain a strong foundation in computer programming.

## Course Overview

The course will be divided into four weeks, each focusing on a different aspect of programming and DSA. Here is a brief overview of what you can expect to learn each week:

### Week 1: Introduction to C Programming

In the first week, you will learn the basics of programming using the C programming language. This will include concepts such as data types, operators, control structures, functions, arrays, pointers, and strings. You will also learn how to write simple C programs and debug them.

### Week 2: Advanced C Programming

In the second week, you will learn more advanced concepts in C programming, including structures, unions, file handling, and dynamic memory allocation. You will also learn how to use the standard library functions and write modular code.

### Week 3: Introduction to C++ Programming

In the third week, you will learn the basics of programming using the C++ programming language. This will include concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and exceptions. You will also learn how to write simple C++ programs and debug them.

### Week 4: Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

In the fourth and final week, you will learn the fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This will include concepts such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and algorithm analysis. You will also learn how to implement these data structures and algorithms using C/C++.

## Prerequisites

To take this course, you should have basic knowledge of programming concepts and algorithms. You should also have access to a computer with a C/C++ compiler installed.

## Course Format

The course will be conducted online and will consist of video lectures, quizzes, coding exercises, and assignments. You will also have access to a community forum where you can interact with other students and ask questions.

## Course Completion

Upon completion of this course, you will have a strong foundation in programming using the C and C++ programming languages and a good understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms. You will also receive a certificate of completion.

We hope you enjoy this course and find it useful for your future programming endeavors. Happy learning!
